## General Info
This website serves multiple purposes:

1. It is a digital portfolio where I highlight the projects I've completed or worked on, providing a comprehensive view of my skills and experiences in the software engineering realm.

2. It functions as a blog where I share my learning journey, discuss intriguing topics I encounter, and delve into various aspects of AI and beyond.

3. It acts as a gallery for displaying images and other unique content I've created using AI.  

In addition to these, the website offers a glimpse into my world beyond coding, featuring my hobbies, interests, and projects outside of software engineering. This eclectic mix of features ensures that the site is not just a professional platform, but also a personal space that reflects my passions and pursuits.
